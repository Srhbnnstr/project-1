## Sprint 1

  As a user:

*  I want to see where I am (something that will direct the user and tell them what kind of product they are using)

*  I want to see a list of different animals

*  I want to be able to add my own animals to the list

Step 1. Create index html file and corresponding css stylesheet. This will include a large banner
created in photoshop that includes the apps name, description and an image. Also included is
a downward arrow below the description to direct users to scroll further down the page.

Step 2. Create a list of pre-created animals stored in seed.js. Use handlebars templating in our html file. Eventually these list items need to be clickable so users can see an individual animals profile appear on the page.

Step 3. Create a form using Bootstrap css forms. This will allow a user to add an animal name,
native habitat and fact(s). Below the form will be a clickable submit button that will submit the
input to our new animals model.
