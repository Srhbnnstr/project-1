## Sprint 2

  As a user:

*  I want to learn new facts about the animal I choose.

*  I want to be able to interact with the list of animals

*  I want to be able to edit the list of animals

Step 1. Create a list of profiles with our animals schema model for individual animals and store them in our seed.js file.

Step 2. Use jQuery to make our animal list clickable for each individual animal and create event listeners for when an object is clicked. When fulfilled, an animals profile will appear on the screen.
Pre-created animal profiles will include more information, such as an image and direct link to that animals wikipedia page, new animal models will not.

Step 3. Add a delete button to all submitted new animals models that any user will
be able to access on the animals list. Delete option will only be assigned to new
animals, not pre-created animals.
